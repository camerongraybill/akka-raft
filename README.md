I did not use any other sources - I just used the extended paper and the 'raft for students' article, and I referenced the Akka documentation a lot

I do not think I have any issues. If there are issues, they would be related to handling multiple requests at once. I did not come up with a good way to write automated tests for that.

'dotnet test' will run the regression tests

'dotnet run --project Main/' will run an interactive terminal where you can read and write to a key value store.

I really enjoyed working on this assignment. I'm glad I took the time to work through all of the bugs I found instead of just turning it in on time.
